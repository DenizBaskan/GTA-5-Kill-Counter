# GTA-5-Kill-Counter
I quickly made this mod because I wanted a kill counter and none of the mods I tried worked. Press `L` or die to reset the counter.

> Requires [ScriptHookVDotNet](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/scripthookv-net)

### Usage
Compiling the project is not neccesary. Copy `KillCounter.cs` into your `/scripts` folder to install.
